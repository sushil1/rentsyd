# rentsyd

This is a demo site for renting houses, I have built using React, Redux, Mongoose and Express. 
It will let you sign up, login and post the rental properties and pictures.
Redux is the state container. Photos are uploaded and served by Cloudinary API. Login is managed with Json Web token.
Also used google maps API for searching, and dragend features to search as you scroll the map around. 
Working on searching listed properties.
